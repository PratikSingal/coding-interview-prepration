- heap is generally implemented using array
- in heap if the the root has the index i then the left node is available at 2*i + 1 and the right node is at 2*i+2
- if you want to find the parent of current node then divide the index by 2:w
- priority queues can be efficiently implemented using binaray heap
- and dijkstra's shortest path uses priority queue to solve it
- prims minimum spannnig tree also used priority queue
- other problems that can be solved using heap are 
    - kth largest element in array
    - sort an almost sorted array
    - merge k sorted array
- since heap is a complete binary tree so array is the best canditate for creating a heap because if tree is complete then there is not wastage of space
- when deleteing an element from the heap. then remove the root element and then bring the last elemen to root and then percolate down
- when inserting an element then insert in the last and then follow percolate up approach
