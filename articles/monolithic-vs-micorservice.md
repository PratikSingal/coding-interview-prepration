> ## Monolithic

- Application is packaged and deployed as one single file

> ## Advantages of Monolithic

- All code is at one place
- Easy versioning
- Since it is a single unit so no difficulty in integration with other system


> ## Disadvantages

- Language 
    - Whole code base is in one language even the feature can be efficient with other programming language
    - can't experiment with other technologies
- Maintainaince and extensibility
    - since the codebase is large so maintainaince and extensibility is difficult
    - if we do a single change then we need to test the whole system so regression testing is very difficult and time consuming

- Testing 
    - Testing of product becomes difficult since you need to test every thing for small changes

- Delayed deployments
    - Generally deployment becomes difficult and is often time taking

- Team Efficiency decreases
    - For every git push conflicts may occurs because multiple team is working in same code base

- Resources are not optimised
    - some modules are I/O intensive like streaming and some are cpu intensive so resources are not fully optimized





> ## Micro service

- Divides one application into multiple parts
