* the name node stores the meta data for the data nodes 
* if the name node fails means the data from disk is erased then the data stored on data nodes is of no use
* if meta data on name node is lost then eventhough data exists on the data node but it is of no use
* so its better approach to not only store the nameNode not only on your own hard drive but also on another network
