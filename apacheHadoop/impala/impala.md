* impala is another hadoop ecosystem technology
* in case of hive it contacts the map reduce code everytime which made the computations slow
* but in case of impala it directly contacts the hdfs file system so the computation is fast in comparision to hive
* impala is used for low latency queries but hive is used for long running jobs
