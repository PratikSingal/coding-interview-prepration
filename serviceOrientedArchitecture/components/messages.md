* the unit of communication in soa is called messageo
Messages can come in many differ­ ent forms, such as these:
    * HTTP GET messages (in the representational state transfer (REST) style)  Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messages
    * Java Message Services (JMS) messages
    * Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) messages

* messages have both header and payload.
* the header is generic which can be understood by framework components without understanding implementation details
* this reduces tight coupling unlike RPC systems whre called had to keep the knowlege of implentationdetails
