# defination
Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural style for build­ ing systems based on interactions of loosely coupled, coarse-grained, and autonomous components called services. Each service exposes processes and behavior through contracts, which are composed of messages at discoverable addresses called endpoints. A service’s behavior is governed by policies that are external to the service itself. The contracts and messages are used by external components called service consumers.

# important terms

* loosely coupled
* course grained
* services
* contracts
* endpoints
* service consumers




# SOA components
* services -- loosely coupled, course grained and autonomous components are called services
these services exposes process and behaviour through contracts
* endpoints 
* message
* contract - some structures messages that when a user gets when he hits an endpoit
* policy
* service consumers - the contracts and messages that are exposed are used by other people known as service consumers



## so we think that what ever we are doing is SOA

lately in 1980 when OOPS was new and great hype then developers call every component as object becaus they were following the hype. but wehn decades passed then they come to know that they were incorrect. same is the case with soa now we don't understand the meaning of soa correctly and we are saying every architecture that we are following is soa


## some misconceptions that we have about soa
* soa is a way to align it and business team    
* soa is an application that has web service interface
* soa is a set of technologies like rest, soap
* soa is reuse strategy


# some benifits of soa architecture
* Reusability—This isn’t reusability in the sense of “write once integrate any­ where,” but rather in the sense that you “don’t throw everything out when you need different functionality.”
* Adaptability—Isolating the internal structure of a service from the rest of the world lets you make changes more easily. You only need to adhere to the con­ tracts you publish.
* Maintainability—Services can be maintained by dedicated, smaller teams and can be tested this way as well. Robert L. Glass has said, “software maintenance is a solution, not a problem”.4 SOA greatly helps make this a reality.


* easier maintainance and replacement of contracts
* standard based service interfaces
* service autonomy 
* externalized policies


# what is five nines rules in software development
five nines means 99.999 (uptime) this means that system should be up of 99.999 percent rather in a year the system downtime should be roughly 5 minutes


# Problems faced by SOA
* desiginging and building SOA
* tieing up services to UI
* It would be nice if there were a few best practices already defined that could tell us how to cope with all of these issues. The truth is that there are no silver bullets in soft­ ware design and development. Every system has its own set of prerequisites, hidden costs, one-off requirements, and special case exceptions. This is exactly why the use of patterns is so appealing as a medium to convey solutions.
