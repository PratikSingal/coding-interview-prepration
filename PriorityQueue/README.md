## Priority Queue

- This is a queue
- Priority queue does not follow the principle of first in first out
- You can insert the elements in random order but minimum element in returned first
- This behaviour of returning minimum elements can be changed by using a comparator
- Priority queue can be best used for creating max heap and min heap
