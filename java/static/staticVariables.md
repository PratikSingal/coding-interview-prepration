* static variables are called class varibles
* such variables get default values based on the data type of the variable
* data stored in static variables is common for all object and if any object changes that data then every object gets the same data
* memory allocation is done only once and it the time when class is loaded in the memory
* it can be accessed directly in static and non static methods
