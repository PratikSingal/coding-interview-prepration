* constructor can be overloaded
* retutn type is not the part of method signature so 
* if two methods are there that have diffeerent return types but same signature then that is not overloaded method

```
// note these two are not overloaded methods as only return type is different and nothing else

public int add(int a, int b){
        return a+b;
}
public double add(int a, int b){
        return a+b;
}



```
