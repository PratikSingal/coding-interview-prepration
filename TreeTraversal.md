## Depth First Traversal

### In-order Traversal

* visit the left tree
* visit the root node
* visit the right tree

#### Uses of In-order traversal

* inorder traversal of binary search tree gives nodes in non-decreasing order


### Pre-order Traversal

* visit root node 
* visit left tree
* visit right tree

#### Uses of preorder

* preorder traversal is used to create a copy of the tree
* used to get prefix expression on of an expression tree


### Post-order Traversal

* visit left tree
* visit right tree
* visit root node

#### Uses of post order traversal

* used to delete a tree
* used to get the postfix expression of an expression tree

## Breadth First 

### Level order traversal
* printing each level one by one for the tree
