> ## Concepts  in functional  programming

- Pure functions
    - Pure function are those functions which
        - They always produce same output for same arguments.
            - since the output is same for same arguments so the compiler can memorize the results and this can help in parallel execution and the program can run fast
        - They don't have any side effects which means that they don't modify the argument or global variable. This is called immutable
    ```bash
        
        sum(x,y){
            return x+y;
        }

    ```

- Recursion
- Referential transparency
- Functions are First-Class and can be Higher-Order
- Variables are Immutable
