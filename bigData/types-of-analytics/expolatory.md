# goals of EDA
* understand the predictors and targets in the data set
    * spreads
    * correlation
* uncover pattern and trends
* find key variables and eliminate unwanted varible. keep those variable which has high correlation
* if we keep unwanted varible then machine learning will not be affected but it will take much time to process
* detect outliers //
* validate previous data ingestion processes for possible mistakes
* test assumptions and hyptesis



# tools for EDA
* correlation matrices
* scatter plots
* box plots
* principal component analysis
