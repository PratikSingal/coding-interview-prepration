* mongodb provides database replication via topology named as replica set
* Replica sets distribute data across machines for redundancy and automate failover in the event of server and network outages. Additionally, repli- cation is used to scale database reads. If you have a read- intensive application, as is commonly the case on the web, it’s possible to spread database reads across machines in the replica set cluster.
* Replica sets consist of exactly one primary node and one or more secondary nodes. Like the master-slave replication that you may be familiar with from other databases, a replica set’s primary node can accept both reads and writes, but the secondary nodes are read-only. What makes replica sets unique is their support for automated failover: if the primary node fails, the cluster will pick a secondary node and automatically promote it to primary. When the former primary comes back online, it’ll do so as a secondary.
