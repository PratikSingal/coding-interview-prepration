* a graph whose vertex can be partioned in 2 sets v1 and v2 such that every edge uv has  u in v1 and v in v2
* so edges in same set can't have a vertex
* complete bipartitie graph is such in which every veritces in V1 and V2 has a vertex with each other`


# star bipartite graph
if the one set of vertex has only one vertices in it then the structure will look like a star so it is called a bipartitie graph
its denoted by K1,4 so one set has only one vertex and the other has 4 vertex
