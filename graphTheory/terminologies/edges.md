* the line connecting two vertices is called the edge of the graph
* we denote and edge by {v1,v2} means edge is connecting v1 and v2


# e = uv
here e is an edge which connects u and v
so we can write that u and v and neighbours or 
u and v are adjacent




* adjacent edges 
if two edges have a common vertex then the two edges are called adjacent edges
