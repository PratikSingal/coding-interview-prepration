# Difference between Interface and Abstract Class

| Interface | Abstract Class | 
| --- | --- | 
| If we don't know about the implementation and just have only requirement specification then we should go for interface | If we are talking about the implementation but not complete (partial implementation) then we should go for abstract class |
