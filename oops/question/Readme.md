# Difference between Interface and Abstract Class

| Interface | Abstract Class | 
| --- | --- | 
| If we don't know about the implementation and just have only requirement specification then we should go for interface | If we are talking about the implementation but not complete (partial implementation) then we should go for abstract class | 
| Inside interface every method is public is public and abstract whether we are declaring or not hence interface is considered as 100% pure abstract class | Every method in abstract class need not to be public and abstract |
