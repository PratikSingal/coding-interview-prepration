# Promise

- Promise is way to write asynchronous call in Nodejs

```javascript

    new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
         
         // based on condition promise can be resolved or rejected
        
    });

```

## Chaining of Promise

- Giving the output of one promise as the input to another promise is called chaining
