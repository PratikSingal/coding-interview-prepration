* when there are more than one independent variable that is used to predict the dependent variable
* the equation
    Y = aX1 + bX2 + cX3 + p
    * here X1, X2, X3 are the independent variables

* same process used for prediction as a single independent variable
* differnt predictors have differnt levels of impact on the dependent variable say X2 affects the value of Y more than X1
