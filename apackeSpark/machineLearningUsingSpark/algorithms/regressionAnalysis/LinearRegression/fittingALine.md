* a scatter plot has been given so we need to draw a boundary line so that that line fits well for all the points in the scatter plot
* given a scatter plot of Y vs X fit a straight line through the points so that the sum of square of vertical distances between the poinst and the line ( calles residuals ) is minimized


# best line = leasts residuals

* a line can always be fitted for any set of points
* the equation of the line becomes the predictor of Y



# Goodness of fit
* R-squared measures how close the data is to the fitted line
* R-squared varies form 0 to 1. the higher the value the better the fit
* you can always fit a line but we need to use R-squared to see how good is the fit
* higher corealation usually leads to better fit
