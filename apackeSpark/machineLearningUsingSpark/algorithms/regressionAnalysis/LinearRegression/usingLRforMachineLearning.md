* ML technique to predict continuous data - supervised learning
* predictors and outcomes provided as output
* data analyzed (training) to come up with linear regression
    * coefficients
    * intercep
    * R-squared // this gives how good is the fit
* linear equation represents the model
* Model used for prediction
