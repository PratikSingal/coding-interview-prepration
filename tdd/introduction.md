* we often hava a scenario where we want to test our code of our product but that product have have dependencies on other systems.
* so while doing the testing we need to have all the system up and if any one one system fails then all our testcases fails.
* this is a problem for development purpose as we can't depend on so many system for out development purpose.
* suppose our function which we are going to test depend on other function which makes a api call to other system so we have a dependency over the api but while testing we need to remove this dependeny



# Benefits of TDD
* it helps us to refactor our code with confidence
* it somewhat provides documentain for the code
