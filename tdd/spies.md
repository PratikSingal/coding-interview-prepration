* which offers information about function calls without affecting their behaviour.
* If we create a spy then we can keep information about a function says how many times it was called during the test. At differnt callls what was the parameter supplied to the function. 
* it just spies what a function does.
* when we are using spies then the original function still runs so if we place a spy on function that makes an ajax call then while running the test then that function still does the ajax call. so spies are just to keep the information about the function to which we are calling.
