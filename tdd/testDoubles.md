* test doubles are just like replacement of some pieces of codes.
* just like in a movie when actor needs to perform a dangerous stunt then stuntman replaces the actor so the movie continues.
* same is the case with our real world code. when we want to make an ajax call then we replace it with some test doubles and we replace it with some code which doesn't make a ajax call but frees our code dependency on the other system.
* sinon splits test doubles into three types
* spies 
* stubs
* mocks
