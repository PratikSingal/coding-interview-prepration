## What is hub.

- hub is a netwoking device that clones bit
- suppose hub has four ports. so if the bit is recieved at port 1 then it will replicate the bit and send the bit to all other ports
- hub doesn't perform any logic and send data to every port
- hub wastes so much bandwidth because it is sending data to every one
- hub works on physical layer because it only replactes the data;w
