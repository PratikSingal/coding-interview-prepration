* we need good data for machine learning

* for a human mind we can easily develop realtionship by seeing on the data because our human mind has the ability to do so 
* but machines can do that on their own so we need machine learing
* we provide predictors and outcomes to the machine learning algorithm and they develop relationship among predictors
* a computer analyzing the data and learing about relationship
* machine learnig results in the model built using the data
