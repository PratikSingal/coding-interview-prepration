> ## Performance Testing

- speed
- Response Time
- Throughtput
- Stability
- Resource usage



> ## Types of performance Testing

- Load Testing

- Stress Testing
  - when the system is going to break 
  - we keep on increasing the load until the system breaks
  - Test beyond normal condition

- Soak / Endurance Testing
  - Taking some load and performing the test for an extended period of time so as to see how is the system performance behaving
  - 100 user for 1 hours
  - 100 user for 5 hour
  - 100 user for 24 hour

- Volume / Spike testing
  - system performance during unexpected load which means sudden increase of load

- Scalability Testing



> ## Performance Testing cycle

- Run Test --> Analyze --> Optimize




> ## How to do performance testing

- Identify the test envronment
- Identify performance Acceptance criteria
- Plan and design test
- configure test environment
- implement test design
- execute test
- analyze, report and retest




> ## Common issues identified

- long user response time
- Memory leaks
- High CPU usage
- Too many open connections
- Length queues of requests
- Too many table scan for database
- Database deadlocks
- Erroneous data returned
- HTTP errors
- Pages not available




## > Concurrency

- when same code is executed by multiple threads in a single process then it is called concurrency
