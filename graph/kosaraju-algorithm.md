# Kosaraju strongly connected components

- linear time algorithm
- used to find strongly connected components of a directed graph





## Kosaraju Algorithm

1. Create an empty stack and do depth first traversal of the graph
2. In DFS traversal after calling  recursive  DFS for adjacent vertices of a vertex push the vertex to the stack
