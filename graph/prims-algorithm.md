## Prims Algorithm

- minimum spanning tree gives the most economical way of connecting all the vertices in a graph
- for example
  - in a network of computer we can connect all the computer with least possible cost if we construt a minimum spanning tree
  - in telephone network communincation we can connect all cities in the network with least possible cost using minimum spanning tree
- Prim's algo is one of the way through which we can create a minimu spanning tree
