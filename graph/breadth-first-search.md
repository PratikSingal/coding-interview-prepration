## Breadth First Search


- the time complexity of breadth first search is O(V+E)  where V is the number of vertex and E is the number of edges
- this depends on the data structure that you are using.
  - if it is adjacency matrix then it will be O(v^2) beacuse for every vertex we will have to check that edge exits with other vertex on not. since it is an array so we need to traverse each cell and total cell will be equal to the number of edges
  - if it is adjacency list 


- BFS can be used for shortest path calculation when the weight of all the edges are same
