> ## Check if the given graph is tree or not

- A graph is tree if
  - the graph doesn't contain any cycle. Cycle can be found in graph if for a vertex v the adjacent vertex u is not visited and if it is visited then u should be parent of v
  - Also the grah should be connected which means that if we perform the traversal of graph from any node then all the nodes shouldb be visited
  - the most important point that should be kept in mind is that if the vertex is visited then is should be parent vertex
