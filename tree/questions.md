## Top view of a tree

- Note when we view a tree from top then only the top most left and top most right nodes are visible. so just print the top left nodes and top right nodes.
- Print all nodes at distance k from a given node
- copy a linked list with random pointers
    - in this one try to insert the copt linked list in between of the the original linked list
    - original->next->arbiraty = original->arbitarty->nextoriginal->arbitarty->next
